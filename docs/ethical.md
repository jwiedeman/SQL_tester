# Ethical and Usage Guidelines

Running security scanners can have legal and ethical implications. Always adhere to the following principles when using this tool:

1. **Obtain Permission** – Only scan systems that you own or have explicit permission to test.
2. **Non‑Destructive Testing** – The scanner is designed for detection only. Avoid payloads that modify data.
3. **Respect Rate Limits** – Excessive requests can degrade target performance. Configure limits responsibly.
4. **Data Handling** – Treat any data returned during testing as sensitive. Do not disclose findings without consent.
5. **Compliance** – Ensure your testing complies with local laws and any applicable organizational policies.

These guidelines help ensure that the scanner is used responsibly and ethically.
